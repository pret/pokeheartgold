I was challenged to a battle\ndownstairs.\rIt’s rough down there. You’d better\nbe careful.
You look like an earnest youth.\nHow come you ended up in\fTeam Rocket...?
Team Rocket never stops bothering\npeople, do they?
There are some shops downstairs...\rBut there are also Trainers.\nI’m scared to go down there.
Yes...\nTeam Rocket can use the tunnel, too.
All the people working at the tunnel\nleft. No one wants Team Rocket to\fgive them a hard time.
Lyra: Hi, {STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}.\nYou are just in time!\r
Lyra: When you follow this tunnel,\nyou’ll see a Dress-Up Shop.\rThat’s where your Pokémon can put on\nAccessories to dress up and\ftake pictures!\rBy the way, here is the Fashion Case!\rDid you say you want it?\nI knew it!\rThis is a present from me!\r
Lyra: Keep Accessories in the\nFashion Case, OK?\rI should get going.\nSee you!\r
