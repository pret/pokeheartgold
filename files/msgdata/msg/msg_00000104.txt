Wait for meeee!!\r
Oh my!\nI fell asleep and ruined my chances\fof being the first to arrive here...\rStupid, stupid me...\nSob...sob...
Stupid, stupid me...\nSob...sob...
Click, click, click...\nOh! It is you!\rI’ve gotten over being first all\nthe time.\rNow I’m counting the number of people\ncoming to the Battle Frontier.\fOf course no one asked me to.\fIt’s just a hobby.
I can’t stop shivering!\rI told my family that I would conquer\nthe Battle Frontier when I left home...\rBut now I’m here, and somehow I\ncan’t stop shivering!\rWhat am I gonna do if I get beaten\nto a pulp?\r
...You look quite young.\r...\n...\rI will pull myself together and\nchallenge the Battle Frontier...\fMaybe!\r
I will pull myself together and\nchallenge the Battle Frontier!\r...\nOr I might not!\r
Finally!\nI’m here at the Battle Frontier!\rWhen a Pokémon battle on the road\ndoesn’t satisfy you any longer, you\fhave to come to the Battle Frontier!\rWouldn’t you agree?
Normally, choosing which Pokémon is all\nthere is to a Pokémon battle.\rBut when you change certain rules or\nlimitations, the battle suddenly\fbecomes even more fun.\rAnd this place you can have such fun...\nis called the Battle Frontier!
This Is the Battle Frontier\rCome, Proud Trainers\nAim for the Top!
