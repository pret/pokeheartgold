Whenever MARILL gets annoyed, it hops\nin the water.\rRecently it jumped into the bath, and\nthere was water all over the place!\rWell, I’ll talk to you more about\nPokémon later!

Where are you right now?\nRoute 12?\rI see... Oh!\nYou should visit the Pokémon House in\fLavender Town!
Where are you now?\nRoute 13?\rIsn’t that where the road becomes a\nbit of a maze?\rThat might be why the Pokémon in that\narea always seem a bit perplexed.
So, you’re around Route 14 right now,\naren’t you?\rThere’s a huge windmill over in that\narea, so it’s very beautiful, isn’t it?

You know, the bridge on Route 24 is\ncalled the “Nugget Bridge.”\rIt’s not an official name, but it seems\nlike a lot of people call it that.\rThe sun’s light reflects off the water\nthere, so it’s kind of dazzling...
You know, I think most Pokémon have\nnever seen their own face.\rSo if you take them to a puddle on\nRoute 25 and let them see their\freflection, I wonder what\fthey’ll think...
You know, Route 26 is so full of natural\nbeauty, I bet it’s a really wonderful\fplace for Pokémon.\rBut it’s also a road leading to the\nPokémon League, so it probably makes\fthem anxious, too.
