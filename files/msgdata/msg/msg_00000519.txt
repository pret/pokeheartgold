Who are you?\rMy name’s Blue.\nI was once the Kanto Champion.\rAlthough it was short-lived thanks\nto Red...\fAnyway, take a good look around you...\r
Blue: A volcano erupts, and just\nlike that, a whole town disappears.\rWe can go on winning and losing in\nPokémon, but if nature so much as\ftwitches, we can be overwhelmed\fin a second...\rThat’s the way it is...\nBut, anyway, I’m still a Trainer.\rIf I see a strong opponent, it makes me\nwant to battle.\r
If you want to battle me...for real,\ncome to the Viridian Gym.\r
I’ll be waiting for you!\r
If you want to battle me...for real,\nshow me how many Kanto Badges\fyou’ve got.\r...\n{STRVAR_1 50, 0, 0}...\rYou’re not ready to battle me...
