I wanted PORYGON, but I was short\nby 100 Coins...
Whew...\rI’ve got to stay calm and collected...\rI can’t lose my cool.\nIf I spend all my time playing here,\fI could get in trouble at home.
I woke up and realized my potential!\rSo, what potential was woken in me?\nWhat’s my hidden power, you ask?\rIt’s a power that lets me see the\nHidden Power of a Pokémon.\rWhen they learn that move, I can tell\nwhat type the move will be.\rSo, want me to use my hidden power?\rI’ll tell you what type your\nPokémon’s Hidden Power will be. {YESNO 0}
I’ll tell you what type your Pokémon’s\nHidden Power will be.\rMy own hidden power lets me\ndo that. {YESNO 0}
If this Pokémon were to learn\nHidden Power, the move’s type\fwould be {STRVAR_1 15, 0, 0}.
This Pokémon’s Hidden Power is the\n{STRVAR_1 15, 0, 0} type.
If you want to know, ask me, and I’ll\nactivate my hidden power for you.
A move that an Egg can learn?!\nThat’s flat-out impossible.
Oh, no. This Pokémon can’t learn the\nmove Hidden Power in the first place.
