I was hoping to buy some Safari Zone\nsouvenirs, but it’s not open!\rI thought it was closed today,\nbut actually it’s gone!\rI never saw it coming.
The Safari Zone has been moved\nto Johto...\rI hear that now the son of the Warden\nis going to run Pal Park!
Have you been to the Pal Park?\rThe Safari Zone Warden’s son is\nrunning it with his wife.\rIt must run in their family to\nmanage parks.
