Hm... Good to see you here.\fNo need to explain why you came.\rClair sent you here, didn’t she?\fThat girl is a handful...\rI am sorry, but I must test you.\rNot to worry, you are to answer only\na few questions.\fReady?\r
What are Pokémon to you? {YESNO 0}
What helps you to win battles? {YESNO 0}
What kind of Trainer do you\nwish to battle? {YESNO 0}
What is most important for\nraising Pokémon? {YESNO 0}
Strong Pokémon. Weak Pokémon.\nWhich is more important? {YESNO 0}
Hm... I see...\nYou care deeply for Pokémon.\rVery commendable.\fThat conviction is what is important!\r{STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}, don’t lose that belief.\rIt will see you through at the\nPokémon League.\r
Hah? I didn’t quite catch that...\r
What was it you said?
Oh, I understand...\r
So how did it go?\rI guess there’s no point in asking.\nYou did fail?\f...\f...What? You passed?\r
{SIZE 200}That can’t be!{SIZE 100}\r
You’re lying!\nEven I haven’t been approved!\r
Clair!\rThis child is impeccable,\nin skill and spirit!\rAdmit defeat and confer the\nRising Badge!\r...Or must I inform Lance of this?\r
I... I understand...\r
Here, this is the Rising Badge...\nHurry up! Take it!\r
{STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0} received\nthe Rising Badge from Clair!
The Rising Badge will enable your\nPokémon to use the move for\fclimbing waterfalls.\rAlso, all Pokémon will know you as\na Trainer and obey your every\fcommand without question.\r
Clair...\rReflect upon what it is that you\nlack and this child has.\r
...\n...\r
By the way...\nHave you heard of LUGIA?\rIt is a Pokémon said to have lived\naround Whirl Islands once...\f...Never mind.\rJust mad words of the old.\n
By the way...\nHave you heard of LUGIA?\fEr...\rBetween Olivine and Cianwood are\nislands called Whirl Islands.\rThere is a huge waterfall deep in the\ncave there. It is said that LUGIA\rrests in the deep end of the\nwaterfall basin...\rYou need a Silver Wing to reach the\nwaterfall basin, I’ve heard...

Come again, if you so desire.
It’s been quite some time since a\nTrainer has gained our Master’s\frare approval.\rIn fact, not since Master Lance.
You know young Master Lance?\rHe looks so much like our Master\ndid in his youth.\fIt’s in their blood.
Hm... Good to see you here.\rYour arrival is most fortunate.\nI have something for you.\rTake this DRATINI as proof that I\nnow know your worth.\r
{STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0} received\nDRATINI from the Master!
Hm? Your party is full.
Dragon Pokémon are symbolic of\nour clan.\rYou have shown that you can be\nentrusted with one.
Clair appears to have learned an\ninvaluable lesson from you.\rI thank you as her grandfather.
A boy close to your age is in\ntraining here.\rHe is much like Clair when she was\nyounger. It is a little worrisome...
Give a nickname to the\nDRATINI you received? {YESNO 0}
