I heard about the Bug-Catching Contest\nwhere Bug-type lovers gather from all\fover the region.\r...Me?\nI cannot take Bug types...
The Bug-Catching Contest is held on\nTuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.\rNot only do you earn a prize just\nfor participating, you also get to\fkeep the Bug-type Pokémon you catch.
Sorry to tell you this, but the\nPokéathlon Dome is still under\fconstruction, and the entrance there\fis off-limits.\rYou know what a rush construction is?\rIn short, they are working really hard.\nIt shouldn’t take too long.\rJust a little more patience, OK?
The Pokéathlon Dome is this way.\rPlease go through the entrance gate,\nand do participate in the games!
Arrgh!\rWhen is the Pokéathlon going to\nbe ready?\rI can’t just sit here and wait!\nI’ll go on an around-Johto run!
I’ve been waiting for this moment!\rBehold my friendship with my Pokémon!
I wonder if I can participate, too.\nIt’s only running with Pokémon, right?
Play collectively with your Pokémon,\ntrust your Pokémon, and believe in your\fPokémon’s potential!\rYour friendship with Pokémon\nwill make your dream come true!\rPokéathlon for you!
Charge your energy with friendship!\nGive Aprijuice to your Pokémon!
Tap tap ding ding!\rWe are in a big hurry!\nJust a little more work before you\fcan come through.\rI hope you are looking forward to it!
Hey, hey!\nWatch yourself! The construction\fmakes it dangerous around here.\rJust wait a little longer for the\nexciting reveal!\r
