Did you just come down from above...?\rSo! You must have solved the\nstone-panel puzzle!\rThat is wonderful!\rYou seem to have some talent with\narchaeology.\fI will give you this UNOWN Report.\rIt records UNOWN as you capture them.\nI am sure it’ll come in handy!\r
There is a strange presence here...
This is a big room, but there’s\nnothing here.
This place has a mystical quality to it.\r...Or a historic quality...\f...Or an eerie quality...\f...Or an ancient quality...\f...Or a solemn quality...\f...Or a frosty quality...\fIn essence, it feels sort of ethereal.
The ruins have not been robbed, nor\ntampered with. No graffiti, either.\rThings are well preserved.\nSomething here must make people\ffeel they should preserve it.
It’s a replica of an ancient Pokémon.
Hmm.\rI have been studying the ruins for many\nyears, but something feels...\fdifferent.\r
Wow!\rThe UNOWN pictures on the wall...\rIt feels like they’re staring at me!\r
What is this?\nThere is something eerie that is making\fmy legs shiver.\fI can’t stop them!\r
Oh, are you all right?\nYou disappeared right in front of me.\fI was so surprised!\r
I see.\rThe power of ARCEUS and UNOWN affected\neach other to create a huge energy,\fwhich sent you to the Sinjoh Ruins...?\rUNOWN, the Ruins of Alph, and ARCEUS...\fThe mystery deepens...\rIt has made me even more inquisitive!\rI will one day solve all the mysteries!\r
