This little girl keeps asking me to play\nwith her.\rOuch! Please don’t stretch my ear!
Thank you for playing with her.\rYou may think being a Captain\nis a somewhat easy job, but\fit’s actually quite demanding.\rThat little passenger has gone out\nof the room.\rShe can’t get off the ship, so she\nmust be hiding somewhere\faround here.
How do you like S.S. Aqua’s ride?\rShe practically skates across\nthe waves.
Long time no see.\nHow are you doing?\rThe S.S. Aqua is as smooth as she\ncan be!\rBy the way, I found this mysterious\nthing when I went to Sinnoh\fthe other day.\rNow that we’ve met again,\nI would like you to have it.\r
Your Bag is full.\rYou must like the {STRVAR_1 8, 1, 0} a lot.
