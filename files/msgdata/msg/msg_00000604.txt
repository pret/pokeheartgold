...\rYou again?\rThere’s no need to be alert.\nI don’t bother with wimps like you.\rSpeaking of weaklings, the city’s\nGym Leader isn’t here, and\fis supposedly taking care of a\fsick Pokémon at the Lighthouse.\rHumph! Boo-hoo!\nJust let sick Pokémon go!\rA Pokémon that can’t battle\nis worthless!\rWhy don’t you go train at\nthe Lighthouse?\rWho knows? It may make you a bit\nof a better Trainer!\r
Dark roads are dangerous at night.\rBut, in the pitch-black night,\nthe sea is even more treacherous!\rWithout the beacon of the Lighthouse\nto guide her, no ship can sail.
That thing you have--\nit’s a Pokégear, right?\fWow, that’s cool.
Wow, you have a Pokémon!\nThat is just so awesome.
You, young Trainer!\nThe sea is sweet!\rSing with me!\fThe sea is blue!\nThe sea is salty!
