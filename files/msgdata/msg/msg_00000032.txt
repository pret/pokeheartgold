Darach: {STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}, congratulations!\rYou are to be commended on your\nmastery for keeping the streak alive.\rOur owner, appreciating your worth,\ndemands you battle the Castle Valet.\rYou are prepared, yes?\r
Darach: Welcome.\rI am Darach, as you know, and I am\nthe Castle Valet.\rLady Caitlin, my employer, is not one\nto accept defeat willingly.\rHowever, for a reason I’m not at\nliberty to disclose, she cannot battle.\rConsequently, I will do battle in her\nladyship’s place.\r...Let me assure you that you won’t be\nshortchanged by facing me.\rEn garde!\r
Darach: Your mastery of Pokémon is as\nbreathtaking as ever.\r{STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}, you certainly are to be\ncommended.\r...However, if I may say so, I noticed\nsomething about the way you battle.\rAfter all, I have had the opportunity\nto watch you closely firsthand.\rSo, what is it that I noticed?\rAs a Trainer myself, it is but proper\netiquette to show you in a battle.\rLet us begin!\nEn garde!\r
Darach: {STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}, you are truly in\npossession of a superlative talent!\rI drew on every reserve of experience\nand etiquette handed down through\four heritage of glorious servitude.\rBut even then, I failed to fend off your\ninspired and inspiring challenge.\rI shall see to appeasing Lady Caitlin’s\ndispleasure at my loss.\r{STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}, please do return to our\nBattle Castle.\rWe will be delighted and feel privileged\nto have you back!\r
Darach: I am humbled...\rWhat I’d perceived to be a weakness\nwas only illusory...\rOr, perhaps you corrected it in the\ncourse of our battle.\rRegardless, your performance was\nstunning again.\rThough she cannot say it, Lady Caitlin\nappears quite taken by your style.\rFor her sake at the very least, please\ndo return to our Battle Castle!\r
