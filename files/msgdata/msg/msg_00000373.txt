...Just like that!\r...\nHuh? Was I too fast?\rI’ll try again. Come this way!\r

Hey, how are your Pokémon?\rIf they’re weak and not ready for\nbattle, keep out of the tall grass.
Do you see those ledges?\nIt’s scary to jump off them.\rBut you can go to New Bark Town\nwithout walking through tall grass.
I wanted to take a break, so I\nsaved to record my progress.
I’m waiting for Pokémon that\nappear only in the daytime.
I’m waiting for Pokémon that\nappear only at night.
I’m waiting for Pokémon that\nappear only in the morning.
Rt. 29\nWest to Cherrygrove City
Rt. 29\nEast to New Bark Town
Lyra: There you are!\r
Ethan: There you are!\r
