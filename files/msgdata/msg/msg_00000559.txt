Pokémon are really smart.\nTraded Pokémon might not listen to you\fright away. For example, high-level\fPokémon sometimes refuse to obey\fwhen you don’t have enough Gym Badges.

Hmm...\rCan you tell me what kind of Trainer\nyou like best?\r
Which kind of Trainer would you like\nto be? {YESNO 0}
{STRVAR_1 14, 0, 0} is the kind of Trainer\nyou want to be? {YESNO 0}
I see! So {STRVAR_1 14, 0, 0} is the kind\nof Trainer you like.\rIf that’s the case, others may\ncome to see you in the same way.\r
Talk to me again if you want to\nlet me know what kind of Trainer\fyou like best.
Hello! You’ve been mistaken for\n{STRVAR_1 14, 0, 0}, haven’t you?\rBut I think you can also pass for\na different kind of Trainer.\rSo, how about telling me what kind of\nTrainer you like?\r
