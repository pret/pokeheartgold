What are Johto’s Pokémon Centers like?\r...Oh, I see. So they’re not much\ndifferent from the ones in Kanto.\rThen I’ll get my friend in Johto to\ncatch a MARILL and trade it to me!
I just happened to come through the\nRock Tunnel. There was some commotion\fat the Power Plant.
Adventures are not always full of\noceans and mountains!\rDaily life can be quite adventurous!\r...By the way, I’ve heard people\ntalking about a cave in Cerulean.\rDo you know anything?
Silph Co.’s head office and the\nMagnet Train station--\fthey’re the places to see in Saffron.
