Mr. Fuji: Welcome.\rHmm... You appear to be raising your\nPokémon in a kind and loving manner.\rThose who love Pokémon come here to\npay their respects to Pokémon.\rPlease pay homage to the spirits\nof Pokémon.\rI’m sure that will make them happy.
There are other resting places of\nPokémon here, I think.\rThere are many chambers that only\nMr. Fuji may enter.
I came with my mom to visit\nPokémon resting places...
The Pokémon that lived with me a\nlong time...\rI didn’t treat them as Pokémon!\fI loved them like my grandchildren...
