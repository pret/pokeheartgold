I’ve been looking for you!\nHere, see this? This is it!\rI’m certain your Pokémon will love my\ngift, too!\r
What’s that?\nWait, you’re near me, aren’t you?\rI can tell.\rHow? Because you give off this aura of\naffection for Pokémon!\rIf you’re nearby, come on and talk to\nme in person about Pokémon stuff!
Hey, listen to this.\nMy {STRVAR_1 0, 10, 0} totally grins when\fI pinch its cheek.\rBut it never grins like that for\nanyone else. I must be special.\rOh, and just now, my PIKACHU beat a\nwild {STRVAR_1 0, 11, 0}!\fA wild {STRVAR_1 0, 11, 0}, I’m sayin’!\rYeah, amazing, isn’t it?\rMy PIKACHU is awesome!\rMy PIKACHU is the greatest!\nTalk to you later.

I must be special.\rOh, and I saw a wild {STRVAR_1 0, 11, 0} a\nlittle while ago. But it wasn’t very\fcute, so I left it...\rPokémon have to be cute. They’re no\ngood otherwise.\rTalk to you later.
How are your Pokémon doing?\rLet’s get together and brag about our\nPokémon!
I’d like you to have a Nugget.\rMy PIKACHU just loves it.\rI’m certain your Pokémon will love\nit, too!

Did you remember?\nThe Bug-Catching Contest is today.\rYou’re going to go, aren’t you?\rI think I’ll participate with PIKACHU to\nshow off its cuteness.
The Bug-Catching Contest is at the\nNational Park today.\rAre you going, {STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}?\nI’m trying to make up my mind.
