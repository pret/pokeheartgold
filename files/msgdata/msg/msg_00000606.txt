Jasmine: Don’t you sometimes feel like\nscrubbing Steel-type Pokémon?\fDon’t you?
Will you trade {STRVAR_1 1, 1, 0}? {YESNO 0}
Jasmine: I like Eggs, too, but\nI’d like a Pokémon, {STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}.\fOne that might have a little training...
Jasmine: I’d appreciate it so much...\nExcept that I cannot accept such\fa precious Pokémon.
Jasmine, the Gym Leader?\nShe’s at the Lighthouse.\rShe’s been tending to a sick Pokémon.\rA strong Trainer is compassionate\nat the same time...
Jasmine uses Steel-type Pokémon.\rShe’s trying to hide her tenderness\nbehind her steely coldness.
That was awesome.\fThe Steel type, huh?\fThat was one heated battle you had!
I knew you’d come here.\rThank you for helping the Gym Leader,\nbut battle is a separate matter.\rGo for it!
Impressive!\rYou should continue your journey to\ndifferent places.\rSince you can use Surf, why don’t you\ntry it on the Lake of Rage?
Giggle...\rI know how capable you are\nfrom the Lighthouse.\rIt’s time you showed that side of\nyourself to Jasmine! Good luck!
You are amazing...\rYou should aim even higher, since\nyou have such potential.\rHave you been to Mahogany Town?
