Cynthia: An Egg is the cradle of every\nbeing. This planet itself is an Egg\fin a sense...\rLife that comes from an Egg will\ncome to an end in due course...\fto begin anew...\rThat may be what ARCEUS\nwanted to show us.\r\n
Cynthia: That was...?\r
Cynthia: We seem to be surrounded by\nthat strong power again...!\r
Cynthia: Of course... ARCEUS!\rSo the source of the power I’ve felt\nwas ARCEUS!\r
Cynthia: What is now the {COLOR 1}Sinjoh Ruins\n{COLOR 0}was built to honor ARCEUS by the\fSinnoh people...\rIt’s an icebound temple that has been\nwaiting for ARCEUS for hundreds\fof years...\r

Would you like to give a nickname\nto the {STRVAR_1 0, 1, 0}? {YESNO 0}
It seems it no longer responds\nto this ARCEUS...
