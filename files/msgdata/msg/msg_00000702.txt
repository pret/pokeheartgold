So, how about we exchange phone\nnumbers?{YESNO 0}
Give me a call if you think of anything!
Uh, OK. That’s too bad...
Did you decide you wanted to\nexchange phone numbers? {YESNO 0}
Uh-huh? Where are you calling from?\rIf you’re nearby, you might as well\ncome over and talk in person, you know?
This is Sue!\rHow have you been since we last talked?\fAre you doing a good job training your\nPokémon? We’re doing great!\r{STRVAR_1 0, 10, 0} is working hard.\rYou have a good Pokémon, too. After a\nwhile, you’ll find it will become a\fsensational partner! Hee hee!
This is Sue!\rHow have you been since we spoke last?\nAre your Pokémon winning their battles?\rWe’re doing great!\nWe even beat a wild {STRVAR_1 0, 11, 0}.\rYou have a good Pokémon, also.\nAll you need now is a great partner...\fKnow what I mean? Hee hee!
This is Sue!\rHow have you been feeling since our\nlast talk? I’ve got many Pokémon... Ah!\rHello? This is Tim!\nLet me talk on the phone... Wah!\rAnyway, he let a wild {STRVAR_1 0, 11, 0}\nget away recently!\rHe sometimes says the strangest\nthings. He said he couldn’t compare\fPokémon with me, but... Ah!\rHello! This is Tim!\nShe is really... Wah!\rYeah, that’s just how it is, isn’t it!\nI’ll leave it at that. We’ll call you\fagain later. Bye-bye!

Hey, did you forget our promise?\rI’m here with Tim, so I’m not getting\ntoo bored, but still...\rWe’re waiting on {STRVAR_1 4, 3, 0},\nso please hurry.
Hey, this is Sue!\nI’m so, so, so bored right now.\rTim stepped out, but I expect\nhim to be back soon. That reminds me!\rWe recently saw a really amazing guy.\rHe was wearing a purple tuxedo and a\nred bowtie. It looked great on him.\rOh--my boyfriend’s back!\nTalk to you later!
