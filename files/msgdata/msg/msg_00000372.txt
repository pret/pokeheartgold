Alas!\nYou’ve found me...\rMy peace and quiet to heal myself from\nthe exhaustion of standing in the\fspotlight has been exposed!\r
What? You are not the media?\nThen you must be one of my fans.\rWhy didn’t you say so?\nGiggle...\rYou can keep it to yourself that\nI’m here, right?\rI’ll give you this for that!\r
It contains Steel Wing!\rI remember I was wearing a dress\ninspired by this move on my\fdebut stage...\rAlas...\nBeing a legendary Idol is so demanding.\rI’ve been retired for some time, but\npeople never stop chasing after me...\flike you!
FEAROW: Feero!
