VOLTORB Flip is a game in which you flip\nover cards to find numbers hidden\fbeneath them.\rThe cards are hiding the numbers\n1 through 3...and VOLTORB as well.\rThe first number you flip over will give\nyou that many Coins.\rFrom then on, the next number you\nfind will multiply the total amount of\fCoins you’ve collected by that number.\rIf it’s a 2, your total will be multiplied\nby “x2.”\rIf it’s a 3, your total will be multiplied\nby “x3.”\rBut if you flip over a VOLTORB, it’s\ngame over.\rWhen that happens, you’ll lose all the\nCoins you’ve collected in the\fcurrent game.\rIf you select “Quit,” you’ll withdraw\nfrom the game.\rIf you get to a difficult spot, you might\nwant to end the game early.\rOnce you’ve found all the hidden\n2 and 3 cards, you’ve cleared\fthe game.\rOnce you’ve flipped over all these\ncards, then you’ll advance to the\fnext level.\rAs you move up in levels, you will be\nable to receive more Coins.\fDo your best!\r
The numbers at the side of the board\ngive you a clue about the numbers\fhidden on the backs of the panels.\rThe larger the number, the more likely\nit is that there are many large numbers\fhidden in that row or column.\rIn the same way, you can tell how many\nVOLTORB are hidden in the row\for column.\rConsider the hidden number totals and\nthe VOLTORB totals carefully as you flip\fover panels.\r
Select “Open Memo” to mark\nthe cards.\rYou can mark the cards with the\nnumbers 1 through 3, but also with a\fVOLTORB mark.\rWhen you have an idea of the numbers\nhidden on the back of the cards, touch\r“Open Memo” and select the cards\nto mark.\rIf you want to remove a mark, touch the\nmark again, and it will disappear.\r
