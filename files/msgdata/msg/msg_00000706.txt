Our battle was remarkable!\rI wish for something to remember\nyou by!\rPerhaps your phone number will do?\rMy training makes it impossible to\nchat much, but... {YESNO 0}
I must train harder to become\nthe mightiest!
If you decide you want my number, come\nand find me.
My training makes chatting tough.\nSo, take down my number? {YESNO 0}
Today, I’d like to thank you,\n{STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}!\rI’ve been training all alone...\nI was happy that you cared to call...\r{STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}! I want you to have this!\r
Your strength will not let you carry\nanother thing! I will hold this till you\flighten your Bag!
Excuse me?\nIf you’re nearby, then I’d appreciate\fthe politeness of talking face-to-face!
Are you still on your journey?\nI remain dedicated to my training.\fOooooaaarrrgh!
My apologies, but I don’t have time to\nchat while I am in training!\rI’ll have time to chat tomorrow!\nYiiihah!
I plan to take a lunch break, so come\nand visit with me then!\fAyiiiyah!
I’m taking a break on Route 45!\nWhy not drop by? We can have a battle!
I rested up over my lunch break.\nNow, it’s time to resume training!\fOooryaah!
