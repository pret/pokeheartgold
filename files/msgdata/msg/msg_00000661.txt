Day-C Man
Hello?\nOh, hello. How are you?\rKids nowadays can just call even though\nthey’re nearby...\rI’d rather talk face-to-face...
Hello?\nOh, it’s you!\r
One of your Pokémon we’re raising is\nholding an Egg!\rI bet you’d like to know what kind of\nEgg it is, right? You should come get it!
We’re not raising any Pokémon for you\nright now...\r
Your {STRVAR_1 0, 10, 0}’s doing just fine.\r
Your {STRVAR_1 0, 10, 0} and {STRVAR_1 0, 11, 0}\nare doing just fine.\r
The two seem to get along very well.\r
The two seem to get along.\r
The two don’t seem to like each\nother much.\r
The two prefer to play separately more\nthan with each other...\r
Come stop by anytime, you hear?
Hello? It’s me, the Day-Care Man.\rWe were raising your Pokémon,\nand my goodness, were we surprised!\rYour Pokémon was holding an Egg!\rWe don’t know how it got there,\nbut your Pokémon had it.\rI bet you’d like to know what kind of\nEgg it is, right? You should come get it!
