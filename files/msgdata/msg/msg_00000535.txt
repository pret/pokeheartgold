...Beep!\rI am so sorry, but you need\na Magnet Train Pass to get on\fthe Magnet Train...\r
Passengers need to go through the\ngate for the automatic ticket check...\r
Ping...fwip!\nHere is your Pass back.\rThis train is about to leave\nfor Goldenrod City.

We have arrived at Saffron! Saffron!\nThe accent is on the “a”!
Enjoy the attractive and magnetic\njourney!\r
The Magnet Train is a super-modern\nrail liner that uses electricity and\fmagnets to attain incredible speeds.\rHowever, there isn’t any electricity.\nIt’s just an iron box.
Whew...\rHow many times have I gone back\nand forth between Kanto and Johto?
Before the Magnet Train station was\nbuilt, there was a house here.\rA little girl who was called Copycat\nused to live in it.
Hi. Do you have a Magnet Train Pass?\rI have one.\rAll the people in Saffron who ride the\nMagnet Train have Passes.
Lt. Surge: Oh! I never expected to see\nyou at a place like this!\fWhat a coincidence!\rI can feel great electric power around\nthe Magnet Train station!\rYou had a PIKACHU, didn’t you?\nHow about trading it for my\fFrench PIKACHU? {YESNO 0}
Lt. Surge: My PIKACHU and\nyour PIKACHU up for a trade,\fwhat do you think?
Lt. Surge: Wow! Electrifying!\nLet’s trade ’em now!\r
Lt. Surge: Shocking!\nI want to share my feelings for\fPIKACHU with you!\rI’m ready anytime, so just bring\na PIKACHU, OK?
Lt. Surge: Yeah!\nI’m so ecstatic! I’ll see you around.\fGood-bye!\r
Lt. Surge: What? That is not\nthe right Pokémon!\rI won’t trade my PIKACHU for\nanything other than PIKACHU.
We request that you make sure your\nPokémon are well behaved or put away\fin their Poké Balls so they won’t lick\fother passengers’ faces.\fThank you.
