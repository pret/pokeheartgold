I have removed the boulder that was\nin the way, but it may still take some\ftime to flatten the ground...
The roadwork is finally finished.\rNow I can go fishing again.
Sorry. This road is closed for\nconstruction.\rIf you want to get to Cinnabar, you’d\nbetter go south from Pallet Town.
I’m all sweaty.\nTime for a swim!
Rt. 19 Fuchsia City to\nSeafoam Islands
What’s this notice?\rPlease be careful if you are swimming\nto Seafoam Islands.\fFuchsia Police
