The GYARADOS are angry!\nIt’s a bad omen!
Hahah! The MAGIKARP are biting!
I heard this lake was made by rampaging\nGYARADOS.\rI wonder if there is any connection\nto their mass outbreak now?
Did my eyes deceive me? I saw a \nred GYARADOS in the Lake of Rage...\rBut I thought GYARADOS were\nusually blue?
