It really made me angry to lose.\nI’ll have to train much harder...\rHere’s my number. I’m Erin--don’t\nforget! Want to battle me again? {YESNO 0}
I’ll remember to call when I want to\nbattle again!
Oh... I’m sad... If you do want to\nbattle, come see Erin--that’s me!
I want to battle with you again.\nDo you want to exchange numbers? {YESNO 0}
Aww... I lost again!\nI wonder how many times that is...\rThanks for coming!\nHere’s a present!\r
What’s up? Wait, are you seriously\ncalling me from that close by?\fAre you scared of me or something?\fWhy not talk face-to-face?
Erin’s {STRVAR_1 0, 10, 0} is much stronger\nthan before! I should know--I’m Erin!\rSee you. Bye-bye!

But, but...\rA wild {STRVAR_1 0, 11, 0} got away from me\nagain. It’s just not fair!\rSee you. Bye-bye!
