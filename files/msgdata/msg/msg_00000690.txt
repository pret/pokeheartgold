To be honest, I want a MARILL.\nBut I make do with my cute SNUBBULL.\rAw! I’m just kidding!\nI’m just kidding, SNUBBULL! You’re the\fcutest Pokémon ever, really!
Oh... That’s disappointing...
You have such cute and adorable\nPokémon with you! \rWe should totally trade phone\nnumbers, don’t you think?{YESNO 0}
Oh, sorry to keep you waiting,\n{STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}. Here, I’ll give you this.\r
Let’s see... You’re in the National\nPark, aren’t you?\rWell, you should come talk to me in\nperson, don’t you think?
I spruced up my {STRVAR_1 0, 10, 0} and made\nit even cuter than before!\rI happened to come across a wild\nSNUBBULL recently.\rMy SNUBBULL, I assure you, was far\ncuter than the wild one.\rYou can expect a call from me.
I spruced up my {STRVAR_1 0, 10, 0} and\nmade it even cuter than before!\rI happened to see a wild MARILL the\nother day. Or so I thought.\rA closer look showed it was\n{STRVAR_1 0, 11, 0}. I was quite miffed.\rYou can expect a call from me.
My husband got some Nuggets.\rIf you’d like, you could have one as\nthanks for helping me out.\rI’ll be at {STRVAR_1 4, 3, 0}.\nPlease come see me when you can.
Pardon?\nOh, the Nugget?\rIt’s all right! There’s no need\nto hurry. Come see me in\f{STRVAR_1 4, 3, 0} when you can.
