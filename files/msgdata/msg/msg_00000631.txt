Clair: I am Clair.\rThe world’s best Dragon-type master.\rI can hold my own against even the\nPokémon League’s Elite Four.\rDo you still want to take me on?\r...Fine.\nLet’s do this!\rAs a Gym Leader, I will use my full\npower against any opponent!\r
Clair: I won’t concede this.\rI might have lost, but you’re still\nnot ready for the Pokémon League.\rI know. You should take the\nDragon-master challenge.\rBehind this Gym is a place called\nDragon’s Den. There is a small shrine\fat its heart.\fGo there.\rIf you can prove that you’ve lost\nyour lazy ideals, I will admit you\fare a Trainer worthy of a Gym Badge!
Clair: What’s the matter?\rIs it too much to expect of you?
Clair: You’ve kept me waiting!\rHere! Take this!\r
Clair: That contains Dragon Pulse.\rWell, Dragon Pulse is a kind of...umm...\nNever mind!\rIt’s a huge energy of some kind.\nIf you don’t want it, you don’t\fhave to take it.\r
What is this? You don’t have room?
Clair: What’s the matter?\rAren’t you headed to the\nPokémon League?\rYour face...it tells me you have some\nunfinished business...\rWait a sec!\nYou came from New Bark Town\fwhere Professor Elm’s Lab is, right?\rYou may want to go back to\nNew Bark Town.\rWhatever you have to face from now,\nit’ll be more difficult.\rBut don’t you dare give up!\rIf you do, I’ll feel even worse\nabout having lost to you!\r...\nGive it your all.
