I recently began observing wild\n{STRVAR_1 0, 10, 0}.\rI’ve been learning all sorts of new\nthings through my observations.\rI wish I could become a Pokémon\nresearcher like Professor Oak soon.\rSee you later!
Oh yes, I managed to knock out a wild\n{STRVAR_1 0, 11, 0} a while back.\rWell, considering all the Pokémon\nstudying I do every day,\fit was inevitable.\rSee you later!
Oh yes, I came close to catching\na wild {STRVAR_1 0, 11, 0}, but it got away.\rFor the longest time, I’ve been wanting\nto observe {STRVAR_1 0, 11, 0}. Man...\rSee you later!\n
