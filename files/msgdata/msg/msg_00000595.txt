Hey. I love strong Pokémon.\rI feed them Protein to crank up\ntheir Attack.
I consider myself a bad guy,\nbut I never liked hanging around\fother bad ones like Team Rocket.
Iron adds to your\nPokémon’s Defense.
Team Rocket...\nWhat are you doing here?
Some Pokémon evolve only\nthrough trading.\rI know of four: MACHOKE, KADABRA,\nHAUNTER, and, um, GRAVELER.\fI heard there are others, too.
Even Team Rocket wouldn’t steal their\nown members’ Pokémon, would they?
