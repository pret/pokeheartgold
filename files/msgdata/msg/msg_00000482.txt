Welcome!\rFeel free to look around anywhere\non this floor.
Sorry, but you can only tour the\nground floor.\rEver since Johto’s Radio Tower was\ntaken over by a criminal gang,\fwe have had to step up our security.
Many people are hard at work here\nin the Radio Tower.\rThey must be doing their best to put\non good shows.
Oh, no, no, no!\rWe’ve been off the air ever since the\nPower Plant shut down.\rAll my efforts to start this station\nwould be wasted if I can’t broadcast.\fI’ll be ruined!
Ah! So you’re the {STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0} who\nsolved the Power Plant’s problem?\rThanks to you, I never lost my job.\nI tell you, you’re a real lifesaver!\fPlease take this as my thanks.\r

Hey there!\nI am the super Music Director!\rI’m responsible for the gorgeous\nmelodies that go out over the air.\rDon’t be square. Grab your music\noff the air!
