You came from Olivine?\rDo you remember the four islands\nalong the way?\rI heard that a mythical sea creature is\nhiding in them.
I heard that you can only see it if\nyou have a Silver Wing.\rIt must have the same scent as\nthe creature.
I’ve heard that the whirlpools around\nthe islands are caused by the\fsea creature.\rYou might need a special move to\nget past them.
