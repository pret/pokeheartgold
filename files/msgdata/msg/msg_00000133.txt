Baoba: It is you!\nIt must have been a long way.\rWelcome to the Safari Zone!\nIt hasn’t been open too long, but you\fcan enjoy all the fun!\rPlease feel free to enjoy my safari!\r
Baoba: I will keep upgrading my safari.\nI will let you know using Pokégear if I\fmake any changes.\r
Safari Zone...\rIt makes me feel like I am in a\nforeign country.\fIt brings up a strange feeling.
..................\n(I am not a talker.)
KANGASKHAN: ..................
This Safari Zone is great!\rI just kept going after Pokémon!\nThat made my JIGGLYPUFF upset though.
JIGGLYPUFF: Puu pupuu.
Safari, safari,\nit is so much fun.\rSafari, safari,\nso interesting, huh!\rSo many Pokémon are waiting for us!\r...That’s a song I made up.\nI sing it when I am in the Safari Zone.
Airily goes the Safari Ball under the\nblue sky. Sprinkly goes your sweat to\fcelebrate a friendship.\rI love the Safari Zone!\r...I made a whole jingle out of it.\nYou think anyone would be interested?
I’ve decided to carry Pokémon drinks.\rThis will be new to me, but I will do\nmy best...\r
Oh, you want to buy something?\nCan you wait while I get it ready?\rJust a minute...\f..................\r
BUTTERFREE: Flu flu.
There are many Pokémon to choose from,\nbut nothing beats the cuteness of\fSLOWPOKE.\rPeople often say that I look like one!
SLOWPOKE: ...Yawn?
I have always wanted to catch my first\nPokémon at the Safari Zone.
You may be under the impression\nthere is a sophisticated system to\fcustomizing the Safari Zone, right?\rThe real truth is that...
Arrrgh...\nI am so exhausted...\fThis job uses so much of your energy...
Safari Zone\rThis is where everything is thrilling.\nFeel free to come by and experience\fthe wild!
