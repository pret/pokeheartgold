Radio is good, you know?\rCool music and Pokémon information...\nSurprising news and moving dramas...\fIt has everything!\rThe only thing missing would be images.\r..................\nOops, they call that a TV!
Lullabies on the radio make wild\nPokémon sleepy.\rThat’s why you don’t see many Pokémon\nwhen the radio plays lullabies in the\ftall grass.
Why would they want to take over the\nRadio Tower?
JIGGLYPUFF: Jiggly...
Sorry. Authorized personnel only\nbeyond this point.\rIt wasn’t that way before. There’s\nsomething wrong with the Director...
Feel free to look around anywhere.\nThe Director is nice again, just as he\fwas before.
