Excuse me, kid!\nI received this letter the other day\ffrom a friend of mine.\rHere’s the reply that I wrote.\rI am stuck here and was wondering\nif you could deliver it...\rHe’s on Route 31.\fCan you help a guy out? {YESNO 0}
Oh... Never mind, then...\nYou must be busy, too.
Huh?\nYour party is full!
Wow, thanks!\r
{STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0} received the\nSPEAROW with Mail!
My friend is on Route 31.\rHe looks obviously eager to read\nletters, so you’ll know who he is\fright away!
My friend is on Route 31.\rOh, yeah.\nThere was a weird tree\fblocking the road.\fI wonder if it’s been cleared?
Thank you for making the delivery!\r...What about a cave exploration?\nAh, you can go right through here.\rI want you to have this for\nyour kindness!\r
My pal was snoozing, right?\nHeh, he’s always sleeping.
What?!\nYou lost the Mail?\fOh, well. That’s OK.\fDon’t worry about it.
Everything is fine!
A strange tree is blocking the road.\nIt wriggles around if you talk to it.\rI heard it became wild when someone\nwatered it with a SquirtBottle.
I like the Pokémon Lullaby they play\non the radio.
I can’t believe such a tiny change\nturns the Pokégear into a radio!\rOh, your Pokégear doesn’t have\nthat feature yet?\rIt’s a shame!\rThey happen to give quizzes at the\nRadio Tower reception on the\ffirst floor.\rIf you can answer them correctly,\nthey’ll give you the Radio Card!\rYou better try it while they\nhave some left!
I may not look it, but I’m pretty good\nat mechanics.\rDo you want to know how to\nlisten to the radio? {YESNO 0}
You open your Pokégear and press the\nradio button. Then you see the screen\ffor tuning in a signal.\rThe middle of the screen is the\nradio-reception map.\rYou can move the blinking mark on the\nmap around to tune in to different\fradio shows.\rFor those who think this is a pain,\nthere are four channels, two on each\fside, for easy tuning.
Was I being a backseat driver?
