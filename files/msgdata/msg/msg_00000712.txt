Don’t young people fish anymore?\rI can teach you how to fish well, if\nyou’d like to exchange phone\fnumbers with me? {YESNO 0}
That’s great!\nI’m happy to have made a\fyounger friend!
Oh...\rMy own kids won’t even give me their\nphone numbers...\rI guess that’s just how young people\nare these days.
Hm? Oh, so you would like to be my\nfriend after all?! {YESNO 0}
If you’re nearby, let’s just talk\nface-to-face!
I’ve been spending more time with my\n{STRVAR_1 0, 10, 0} than I have with my kids.\fThat’s a bit sad, actually.\rYou call your mom sometimes, too!
I just beat a wild {STRVAR_1 0, 11, 0}.\nI told my kid, but he scoffed that he\fcould do the same thing easily.\rBoy, has he gotten cocky...\rYou call your mom sometimes, too!
Yesterday a wild {STRVAR_1 0, 11, 0} slipped\naway from me in front of my kid.\fI was feeling down about it until he\fshared his Poké Balls with me.\rHahah, that sure made my day!\rYou call your mom sometimes, too!
What do you say to a battle with me?\nGood, you’re going to do it!\rFor a kid, you’re quite agreeable.\n{STRVAR_1 4, 3, 0} is the spot!
So where are you? I’m waiting for you\nto show up on {STRVAR_1 4, 3, 0}.\rYou shouldn’t make your elders wait!
Hey, how are you doing?\rI’m doing absolutely wonderful,\nof course!\rBut when I say “...absolutely\nwonderful,” am I talking about fishing?\fAm I talking about Pokémon?\fWhich is it?\rHa ha ha!\nIt’s both, of course!
