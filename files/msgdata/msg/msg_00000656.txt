Chuck
Huh? Wha...? I can’t hear you.\nMaybe we’ve got a bad connection.\rGo somewhere else and try\ncalling again!
Hello?!\nOh, hey, sorry for shouting!\rI’m doing great!\r
You know there’re some stronger\nGym Leaders around.\fDon’t lose heart! Keep going!
Let’s see... I’m free most Wednesday\nnights. Give me a call then, OK?
Oh hey! I just finished training.\nDo you want to battle again? {YESNO 0}
All right!\rI’ll be waiting over at the Fighting Dojo\nin Saffron City!
Noooooo!\nThat’s terrible!
Hmm... You’re just battling me, right?\nDon’t you have other plans?
I’ll be waiting at the Fighting Dojo in\nSaffron City.\fLook forward to it!
Yo! Chuck here!\nWhat’s up?\r
Hey, didn’t we make plans to meet at\nthe Fighting Dojo in Saffron City?\fDon’t tell me you forgot?\fCome on, man! I’m waiting!
You know, I spend a lot of time training\nunder a pounding waterfall every day.\rI guess that’s why I’ve been\ndisagreeing with my wife a lot lately.\rI was thinking of taking her on a trip as\nan apology, but I can’t think of any\fgood places to go.\r...That’s it!\rI should take her to Tohjo Falls! What\ndo you think?
You know, I’m just going to say this\nonce, but I...\rI really like sweets. They’re the best.\rAfter training every day, the thing\nthat I absolutely look forward to more\fthan anything is sneaking behind my\fwife’s back to eat something sweet.\rFortunately, I haven’t been packing on\ntoo many pounds...\rOh! Don’t tell my wife! Please!
Lately my Gym’s waterfall device has\nbeen malfunction... Aaaaahh!\rBoomwhooshoowhooshoowhoosh\foowhooshoowhooshoowhoosh\foowhooshoowhooshoowhoosh...!\r...Haa haaa haaaaa. Sorry.\nWhile I was on the phone with you, the\fdevice broke and I just got doused\fwith water.\rI’ll call you back once things have\ncalmed down a bit here!
