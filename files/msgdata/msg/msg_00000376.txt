People usually come to my house\nlooking for Mr. Pokémon’s house.\fYou did mean to visit my house, right?\rHow kind of you!\nDo you...have any Apricorns?\fApricorn trees bear fruit once a day.\fI have one of those trees, too!\rApricorns are really something.\nYou can make Poké Balls and\fother things.\rThey are quite useful.\rI have a feeling this is meant to be.\nI’m so happy that I’ll give you this!\r
                     
With that Apricorn Box, you can carry\nso many Apricorns.\fYou’ll be a decent Apricorn collector!
Hey, collector of Apricorns!\rHave you noticed that Apricorn colors\nare different from tree to tree?\rTry to remember what color Apricorn\nyou get from each tree!
