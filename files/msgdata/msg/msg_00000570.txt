All the SLOWPOKE have disappeared\nfrom the town.\rThe forest’s protector may be\nangry with us...\rIt may be a bad omen. We should stay in.
The SLOWPOKE have returned...\rBut my FARFETCH’D haven’t come back.\nMy apprentice has gone to look for them\fin the Ilex Forest.\rIt’s been ages now.\nWhere in the world is that lazy guy?
You chased off Team Rocket and went to\nIlex Forest alone?\rThat takes guts!\nI like that. Come train with us.
Where have all the SLOWPOKE gone?\nAre they out playing somewhere?
I’m sorry--I forgot to thank you.\nThis is Charcoal that I made.\rFire-type moves will become\nmore powerful when a Pokémon\fholds that.
{STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0} received\nthe Charcoal!
The SLOWPOKE came back, and you even\nfound FARFETCH’D.\fYou’re the coolest, man!
Uh-oh, your Bag is chock-full.
FARFETCH’D: Kwaa!
