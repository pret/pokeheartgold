We’ll have to beef up our security\npresence so something like this will\fnever happen again!
The generator’s up and running.\nIt’s making electricity to spare.
The generator’s running again!
Since the generator’s been fixed, the\nManager has been cheerful.
All right! We can finally get the\nMagnet Train running again.
I collect Pokémon.\nDo you have a DUGTRIO?\rWant to trade it for my MAGNETON? {YESNO 0}
Yay! I got myself a DUGTRIO!\nThanks!
Huh? That’s not DUGTRIO.\nWhat a letdown...
You don’t want to trade? Aww...
Hi, how’s my old MAGNETON doing?
