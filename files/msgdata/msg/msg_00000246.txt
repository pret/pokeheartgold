Don: You won? The winner is you!?\rI’m so jealous... It’d be fantastic\nto be the winner...
Ed: My PARASECT makes Pokémon fall\nasleep with Spore.
Ed: You can’t win with Pokémon that are\nrun down or low on HP.
Ed: I envy you. I just couldn’t do it\nthis time.
Abby: I’ve been training Pokémon that\ninflict status problems for\fthis contest.
Abby: I heard that using Pokémon with\nbeautiful colors makes it easier to win.\fI wonder if that’s true?
Abby: Wonderful! You sparkle and gleam\nright now. You really do!
William: Winning? I’m more interested in\nfinding rare Pokémon.
William: Well, I’m satisfied because\nI caught a Pokémon I wanted.
William: You’re the winner? What did you\ncatch? Show me, show me!
Benny: ...... ...... ......\n...... ...... Ssssh!\rYou’ll scare off SCYTHER.\nI’ll talk to you later.
Benny: Listen, I caught a SCYTHER\nbefore, but I didn’t win.
Benny: I just came to see how things\nwere going today, you know?\rI’ll really try my best next time!
Barry: You should weaken bug Pokémon\nfirst, then throw a Poké Ball.
Barry: It’s easier to win if you get a\nhigh-level bug Pokémon. But I think\fthey also consider some other points.
Barry: That Pokémon you caught...\nIt’s awesome!
Cindy: I really love bug Pokémon!
Cindy: I really love bug Pokémon!\rDid I already say that?
Cindy: Congratulations on winning!\nBy the way...\rDid I mention that I really love bug\nPokémon?

Josh: It’s called a Bug-Catching\nContest, not a Bird-Catching Contest!\rYou, of all people, should know that.\nAfter all, you won!
Samuel: What?\nIf you’ve got the time to chat, go find\fsome bug Pokémon.
Samuel: So... I thought I would\nscore higher...
Samuel: It’s so disappointing...\nI won’t forget this defeat, and...
Kipp: I’ve studied bug Pokémon a lot.\nI’m going to win for sure.
Kipp: I study a lot, but that’s not\nenough to win.
