There’s no Hurdle I can’t jump! Watch\nmy beautiful footwork!\r
I can climb over any obstacle, I can\njump any Hurdle!\r
Hurdles are not obstacles! You can\njust run around them!\r
I was born to snatch Pennants! I am\nthe ruler of this beach!\r
When you see Pennants, you think of me!\nI am a Pennant-capturing hero!\r
The sandy beach is my field!\nI run about it freely!\r
There’s no Pennant I can’t capture!\nI’ll even capture the championship!\r
Push! Push! Push!\nPush it aside!\r
There’s nothing I can’t push! I’ll push\nyou out of the Circle to be alone!\r

What’s with the intimidation you might\nfeel? I can push without touching!\r
Smash! Crash! Shatter!\nI was born to smash Blocks!\r
There’s nothing I can’t smash! I am the\nPokéathlon Destruction King!\r
There’s a huge wall over there I’m\nsure! It’s just there for me to smash!\r
Keep breaking Blocks...and you’ll\nnotice the mountain over there.\r
My body just automatically catches any\nDiscs that come my way!\r
I’ve come to catch Discs and catch the\nPokéathlon!\r
The Disc you caught is tomorrow’s\nshooting star!\r
Bring it on. I’ll catch it! I’ll catch\nany Disc that comes my way!\r
The jump was like the wind!\nThe form was like a cloud!\r
Jump high to the sky!\nThe form is weightless!\r
A Pokéathlete that can read the\nflow of the wind and control the air.\r
There’s no border between the ground\nand the sky within me!\r
There’s no one who can stop me!\nI was born to run!\r
I’ve never seen strength like this!\nJust running all day long!\r
Once I get moving, I can’t stop!\nI’m in a perpetual Pokéathlon!\r
My engine is friendship, and my motor\nis victory!\r
There’s no chance! I’ll knock down all\nPokémon competition!\r
Getting in the Ring is the end! Fight to\nbe the last Pokémon standing!\r
Ruler of the Ring!\nEnter another’s Ring at your own risk!\r
What exactly are you anyway?\nThat’s what the Ring will tell you!\r
Throwing Snow is the best in the world!\nWith that kind of accuracy, you can win!\r
The Snowballs we’re throwing are\nrolled-up balls of friendship!\r
Such rapid-fire throwing! Who’s that\nSnowball for?!\r
I don’t know where it will leap from\nnext! The Snowballs seem to split!\r
No one can stop this ball! It will hit\nany Goal I aim for!\r
Use that wonderful teamwork and make\nthe Goal!\r
Such splendid footwork!\nAim for success!\r
Live with the ball.\nLive inside the ball!\r
Give the points as a gift to them. It’s\nthe embodiment of fair play.\r
Smile even when you miss! The\nPokéathlon isn’t just about winning!\r
You don’t hesitate to aim for your\nown Goal!\r
Don’t fight over who rolled the ball\ninto your Goal! It’s your friendship!\r
Why do you stand out like that? Winning\nis not the only thing in the Pokéathlon.\r
Here it is! What you’ve all been waiting\nfor! Autographs after the competition!\r
If you want to see me win, I’ll show you\njust how I win!\r
When I do my best and win, I make\neveryone happy!\r
