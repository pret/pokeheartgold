I... I’m in shock!\rA guy about your age with piercing\neyes and long hair came in.\rHe scared me into giving him my\nprized Pokémon!\rI still have one left, but what if\nhe comes back?\rYou look strong.\nCould you look after my Pokémon\ffor a while? {YESNO 0}
Oh, thank you!\nTake good care of it, please!\r
{STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0} received\na Pokémon!
Your Pokémon party is full.
Oh, no... What’ll I do if he comes back?
Hi! How’s my Pokémon?\rI think I’m safe now, so may I have\nit back? {YESNO 0}
Hi! How’s my Pokémon?
Thank you!
Hey, that’s not my Pokémon.
My Pokémon has come to like you.\rAll right, you should keep it.\nBut promise to be good to it!
Oh, no, no...\nThat’s the same as being robbed.
For Pokémon, happiness is being\nwith a person who treats them well.
Huh?\nIt’s holding an item.\fYou should keep that.
Huh?\nIts Poké Ball has a Ball Capsule on it!\fPlease remove it.
Huh?\nYou...only have one Pokémon!\fYou can’t give it back to me then.
