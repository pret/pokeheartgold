Kanto’s Power Plant?\rIt’s near the end of Route 9, the road\nthat heads east from here.\rI think there was an accident of\nsome sort there.
You’re collecting every single kind\nof Pokémon?\rThat must be quite a challenge, but\nit sounds fun, too.
The cape in the north is a good\nplace for dates.\rGirls like it!\rJust between you and me...\nMisty, the Gym Leader, is sometimes\fthere at the cape.\rGuess I don’t stand a chance!

This shady character asked me just now\nhow to get to the Power Plant.\rHe said it must be kept\n“...confidential.”\rWhat does that mean?
A shady character sneaked into\nthe Gym! What business does\fhe have with Misty?
I saw this shady guy in black go\noff toward the Cape.
I’m a huge fan of Cerulean Gym’s Misty.
I heard of a cave here that had\nhorribly powerful Pokémon in it.\fThat’s why I came here.\r
Ayuh?\rMy Dowsing Machine is responding...
This is...\nThe notorious Cerulean Cave!\rHorribly powerful Pokémon live here.\nOnly those who have defeated all eight\fKanto Gym Leaders are allowed to\fchallenge it.
