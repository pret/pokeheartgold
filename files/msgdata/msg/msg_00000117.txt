If you dress up any Pokémon again,\nthe photo here will be changed.\rWould you like to dress up\na Pokémon, dearie? {YESNO 0}
Why don’t I dress up myself and hang a\npicture...?\rThe title should be...\nHmm...how about “Girl’s Paradise”?

I put your photo up right here.\nIt just looks so perfect there!
It’s a frame for holding a\nportrait photo.
