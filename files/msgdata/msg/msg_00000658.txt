Bugsy
Huh? I can’t hear you very well!\nI think we’ve got a bad connection.\rCall me back from somewhere else!
Hello? How are you?\nI’m doing great as usual!\r
There are so many stronger Gym\nLeaders than me out there.\rYou’re trying to visit every Gym around\nthe region, aren’t you?\fThat’s great! Keep up the good work!
On Thursdays around noon, I’m\nusually free.\fIf you want to see my Bug-type Pokémon\fagain, you should call me then!
Oh, you called at just the right time!\nI’m not doing anything right now.\fWanna battle again? {YESNO 0}
All right!\rSee you at the Fighting Dojo in\nSaffron City!
I see...\nWell, there’s no helping that...
Huh?\nIt’s great that you want to battle,\fbut don’t you have other plans?\rYou should take care of those plans\nfirst, and then give me a call.
All right, I’ll be waiting for you at the\nFighting Dojo in Saffron City!\fRace you there!
Yeah, this is Bugsy...\nWhat’s up?\r
Hey, didn’t we make plans to meet at\nthe Fighting Dojo in Saffron City for a\fbattle? Did you forget or something?
You know, everyone’s really into\nBug-type Pokémon when they’re kids.\rBut then for some reason, as people\ngrow up, at some point they all start\fto like Bug-type Pokémon less and less.\rHow about you?\nDo you still like Bug-type Pokémon?\rEven if I grow up I’ll never stop liking\nBug-type Pokémon, no way!
My Gym has such a different trick to it,\ndoesn’t it?\rIt may seem like it was really difficult\nto get a trick like that set up...\fBut the truth is, it was actually\fpretty easy.\rFirst we ran the ropes through the\nGym, then all the Pokémon helped us\ffinish everything else up!
I think I’ve already mentioned this to\nyou, but did you know I’m doing\fresearch on Bug-type Pokémon?\rThere’s so many different kinds, it’s a\nbit difficult, you know?\rI’m just studying Bug-type Pokémon,\nand yet it’s still this difficult.\rPeople like Professor Elm and\nProfessor Oak who study all the\fdifferent types of Pokémon are really\fsomething else, you know?
