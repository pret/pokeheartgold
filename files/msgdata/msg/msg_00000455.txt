Where in the world is Viridian’s\nGym Leader?\fI wanted to challenge him...
Viridian’s Gym Leader does not\nrely on others!\rThe Gym Leader claims that his policy\nis to lose to no one without having\fany underlings.\rThat makes him even more popular,\nand many Trainers have come to work\ffor him.
I heard that the Gym in Cinnabar\nis gone.\rI wonder what became of Blaine,\nthe Gym Leader.
My dream is to become a Gym Leader.
