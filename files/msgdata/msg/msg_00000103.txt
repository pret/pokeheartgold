Which topic should I explain? {YESNO 0}
The Battle Frontier has five facilities\ndedicated to battling.\rAt the Battle Tower, the objective is\nto beat seven Trainers in a row.\rAt the Battle Hall, you may keep battle\nrecords of individual Pokémon.\rAt the Battle Factory, you must win\nconsecutive battles with rentals.\rThe Battle Castle forces Trainers to\nmanage Castle Points to advance.\rAnd finally, the Battle Arcade is where\nrandom luck triggers events.\rYou can try any of these facilities!\r
The battles at the five Battle Frontier\nfacilities are held under special rules.\rFirst and foremost, no Exp. Points\ncan be earned.\rConsequently, the Pokémon battling\nhere will not level up.\rIf the Level 50 rule is chosen,\nPokémon of higher levels will be\ftemporarily reduced to Lv. 50.\rPokémon under Lv. 50 will be entered\nwithout an upward level adjustment.\r
Battle Points are usually referred to\nas BP.\rBP are points that are used only in\nthe Battle Frontier.\rBP are awarded for meeting certain\nperformance goals at the various\fBattle Frontier facilities.\rBP can be exchanged for prizes at\nthe Exchange Service Corner.\r
The Exchange Service Corner is\ncomprised of two tents straight\fahead past here.\rThere, you may exchange your BP for\na wide variety of prizes.\rPlease do visit it!\r
The Performance Monitor shows Trainer\ndata, such as the previous record and\fthe best record to date.\rYou will find one near the reception\ncounter in each facility.\r
We hope you enjoy your visit!

The Battle Frontier is up ahead!\nI have explored places all over the\fworld, but nothing compares to the\fexcitement I feel right now!\rWhat kinds of Trainers will I see?\nWhat battles will I experience?\rIt’s a whole new adventure for me!
The five facilities of the Battle\nFrontier are...\rTower.\rHall.\rCastle.\rFactory.\rAnd Arcade.\rHow do you make an acronym out of\nthat? THCFA?\rRearrange those letters, maybe?\nFATCH! CHAFT!\r...Nope! Nothing works!\nDidn’t anyone think of this?!
