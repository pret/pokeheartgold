Yo, challenger!\nBugsy made this Gym. It’s a huge nest\fof Bug-type Pokémon.\rBugsy’s young, but he’s a master of\nBug-type Pokémon!\rIt’s going to be tough without\nmy advice.\rLet’s see... Bug-type Pokémon don’t\nlike fire.\rFlying-type moves are\nsuper effective, too.
Well done! That was a great clash\nof talented young Trainers.\rWith people like you, the future of\nPokémon is bright!
